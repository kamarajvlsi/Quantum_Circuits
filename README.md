This documents are describing the behaviour of the various Reversible Logic Gates and our Proposed reversible KMD Gates in Quantum Equivalent Circuit.

The various reversible gates defined in quantum levels are, Fredkin, Toffoli, LCG, MIG, MNFT, MRG, Peres and ZPLG.

These gates are useful to analyze the Fault Tolerant of the Reversible Circuits.

Using these Basic Gates and Customized Reversible gates, various Digital circuits are defined such as Multiplexer, Adder, Parallel Adder, D-Flip Flop and so on.
